# Gibberish Bot
This is a python that uses Flask to build a webhook for Facebook's Messenger Bot API and return gibberish to the users who talk to it.

## Installation

1. Get started with the [Facebook messenger platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform).
2. Set up a webhook service. I used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
3. Commit the app to the webhook service. Heroku takes `git push heroku master`
4. Enjoy!

## Usage

This project was designed to test usage of the Messenger platform. It may become more than just gibberish in the future.
